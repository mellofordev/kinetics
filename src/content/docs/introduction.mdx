# Introduction

Kinetics is an open-source library for building interactive learning experiences, similar to [brilliant.org](https://brilliant.org).

## What is Kinetics?

Kinetics provides three categories of components:

- **LearnUI** - shadcn-based UI components with custom variants and themes
- **Diagram** - SVG components with animation and physics controls
- **Hooks** - Pre-made hooks for physics simulations and animations

## Philosophy

Components are designed to be:

- **Copy-pastable** - No complex setup, just copy and use
- **Customizable** - Full control over styling and behavior
- **Composable** - Components work together seamlessly
- **Type-safe** - Full TypeScript support

## Distribution

All components are distributed via the shadcn CLI:

```bash
npx shadcn@latest add https://your-domain.com/r/button.json
```

This copies the component source directly into your project, giving you full ownership and control.
